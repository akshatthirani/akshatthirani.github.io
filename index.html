					<p>My passion lies on the intersection of inventive engineering and empathetic design. I believe in adding value by solving real problems through creation. As a Junior studying Computer Science and pursuing the Segal Design Certificate at Northwestern University, I am currently developing a product that provides critical data associated to one’s home-energy consumption. Products in this domain – those that provide meaningful data to drive decisions, are most meaningful and exciting for me. Outside of the realm of technology, you will find me playing my guitar, drawing, mountaineering, or at a concert</p>
