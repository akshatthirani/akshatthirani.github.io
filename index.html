	<h1><small>About me</small></h1>

	<p class="lead">Hi! I’m Akshat, and I am passionate about product design and web technologies.

	I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science at Northwestern University, along with pursuing the Segal Design Certificate. My primary interest is in front-end development and the UI/UX aspect of product design. I am also really interested in the Internet of Things space and web development using the MEAN (JavaScript-based) stack. 

	I began programming 6 years ago in a high-school CS class in C++, and I’ve been loving it ever since. The pace and reach of web-based products really excites me and the ability to make a difference using code is very empowering. 
<br>
	I believe in the power of drawing and my design process always begins with a paper and pencil, using which I visually chart out the plan and work through iterations. Through classes at Northwestern such as Human-Centered Product Design, Design Thinking & Communication, Human-Computer Interaction, as well as side projects, I’ve grown to appreciate empathetically working on solutions and creating quick and short-looped iterations. 

	I’ve attended several Hackathons, such as HackMIT, Campus 1871, Wildhacks and MHacks – and they are awesome. I’m always looking to collaborate on projects or even just talk to people excited about technology and design.

	Outside of school and projects, I love playing the guitar, drawing, traveling and mountaineering. 

	Feel free to reach out to me!

<div class="porRao">
	<h3>Pors & Rao</h3>

	<p class="lead">Over the summer last year, I worked for the artist duo Pors & Rao, whose artworks are based on electro-mechanical systems and interactive installations. 
		<br>
		I worked on the implementation of two artworks and had experience with electronics prototyping and mechanical fabrication. I also worked under aesthetic constraints such as sound, material, motion and space was a unique and taught me a lot. Working on technology that served as artwork and evoked a viewer’s curiosity and humor was one the best experiences. 
		<br>
		I worked on the first two artworks talked about in this TED talk:

<div class="amper">
	<h3>Ampér</h3>

	<p class="lead">
		This project evolved over Wildhacks – Northwestern University’s hackathon. The product aims to capture energy consumption data in homes by recording data from Circuit breakers, and analyzing the time series of energy levels to give device-level information.
		<br>
		I’ve built the project from scratch and have used D3.js for the visualization, and firebase for the data storage. I am currently prototyping the hardware and using the MEAN stack for deployment. 
		<br>
	</p>
</div>

<div class="summr">
	<h3>Summr</h3>

	<p class="lead">
		I built this over the Campus 1871 hackathon in a team of 4, and was the visual designer of the team. Summr is an app that connects students interning in a new city to give them a better experience by giving them a curated experience of the city. Through this app students could connect to other students on the app while exploring the city or going to events together. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="roomAssign">
	<h3></h3>

	<p class="lead">
		This project evolved from a Human-Computer Interaction class over Winter ’14. RoomAssign is a redesign of the campus-housing application for Northwestern University. In a team of 4, we developed conceptual models and wireframes, did user surveys, used statistics for design decisions, and applied several other design techniques to develop the website. We used Bootstrap to make it mobile-friendly, jQuery for most effects and transitions, and the Google Maps API for visualization. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="lockHolder">
	<h3>U-Lock Holder</h3>

	<p class="lead">
		As part of a Human-Centered Product Design class, my team and I designed a U-Lock Holder. The class taught principles of Design Thinking and as created several iteration through constant user feedback. The course introduced observational methods, product benchmarking, concept generation, prototyping and testing, and business models. We used statistics for several design decisions and gathered data and, by the end of the course, built a high-fidelity prototype.

<div class="formulaSae">
	<h3>Formula SAE</h3>

	<p class="lead">
		As part of Northwestern Formula Racing – Northwestern’s Formula SAE team, I was in the composite team and worked on Carbon Fiber parts of the car. Developed CAD models and conducted FEA testing. Worked with other teams, such as frame and electronics, to create parts that fit into the system.
